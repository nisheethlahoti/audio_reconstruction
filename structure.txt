For each cpp file that's a descendant of the 'src/soundrex' folder:
	If it's named 'lib':
		It's linked into binaries of all files built in its directory's descendants.
	else if one of its ancestor directories shares its name with a cpp file in that ancestor's parent:
		It's linked to the latter cpp file's binary.
	else:
		It's built into its own binary.
